    <p>Stutor is an online social interactive platform that connects students who need extra help academically with other students who can offer that help.</p>
    <p>The project was founded in July 2023 by the TH company, based in Mukono, Uganda.</p>
    <p>The team behind Stutor is passionate about improving the lives of students who struggle with their grades. They believe that everyone deserves access to quality education, and that Stutor can help to make that happen.</p>
    <p>Stutor is still in its early stages, but the team is excited about the potential of the project. They believe that Stutor can make a positive impact on the varsity community and inspire others to come up with solutions to various problems and improve people's lives.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the goals of Stutor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the lives of students who struggle with their grades.</li>
      <li>Make quality education more accessible to everyone.</li>
      <li>Inspire others to come up with solutions to various problems and improve people's lives.</li>
