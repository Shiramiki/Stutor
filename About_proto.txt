  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p>The Stutor project, founded in July 2023, is an online social interactive platform created by the TH company based in Mukono, Uganda.</p>
  <p>Our aim is to enable students who need some extra help academically to be able to connect with other students who can offer them the help they need.</p>
  <p>With an exceptional team of empowered intelligent young minds behind this project, our journey seeks to find a way to improve on the life of the average student, who struggles with his/her grades and is unable to acquire assistance. We are determined to bring a positive impact to the varsity community and inspire others to come up with solutions to various problems and improve people's lives.</p>
